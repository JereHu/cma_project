   abstract = {Purpose: With few cycling races on the calendar in 2020 due to COVID-19, Everesting became a popular challenge: you select one hill and cycle up and down it until you reach the accumulated elevation of Mt. Everest (8,848 m or 29,029ft). With an almost infinite number of different hills across the world, the question arises what the optimal hill for Everesting would be. Here, we address the biomechanics and energetics of up- and downhill cycling to determine the characteristics of this optimal hill. Methods: During uphill cycling, the mechanical power output equals the power necessary to overcome air resistance, rolling resistance, and work against gravity, and for a fast Everesting time, one should maximize this latter term. To determine the optimal section length (i.e., number of repetitions), we applied the critical power concept and assumed that the U-turn associated with an additional repetition comes with a 6 s time penalty. Results: To use most mechanical power to overcoming gravity, slopes of at least 12% are most suitable, especially since gross efficiency seems only minimally diminished on steeper slopes. Next, we found 24 repetitions to be optimal, yet this number slightly depends on the assumptions made. Finally, we discuss other factors (fueling, altitude, fatigue) not incorporated in the model but also affecting Everesting performances. Conclusion: For a fast Everesting time, our model suggests to select a hill climb which preferably starts at (or close to) sea level, with a slope of 12–20% and length of 2–3 km.},

   abstract = {Despite the wide use of surface electromyography (EMG) to study pedalling movement, there is a paucity of data concerning the muscular activity during uphill cycling, notably in standing posture. The aim of this study was to investigate the muscular activity of eight lower limb muscles and four upper limb muscles across various laboratory pedalling exercises which simulated uphill cycling conditions. Ten trained cyclists rode at 80% of their maximal aerobic power on an inclined motorised treadmill (4%, 7% and 10%) with using two pedalling postures (seated and standing). Two additional rides were made in standing at 4% slope to test the effect of the change of the hand grip position (from brake levers to the drops of the handlebar), and the influence of the lateral sways of the bicycle. For this last goal, the bicycle was fixed on a stationary ergometer to prevent the lean of the bicycle side-to-side. EMG was recorded from M. gluteus maximus (GM), M. vastus medialis (VM), M. rectus femoris (RF), M. biceps femoris (BF), M. semimembranosus (SM), M. gastrocnemius medialis (GAS), M. soleus (SOL), M. tibialis anterior (TA), M. biceps brachii (BB), M. triceps brachii (TB), M. rectus abdominis (RA) and M. erector spinae (ES). Unlike the slope, the change of pedalling posture in uphill cycling had a significant effect on the EMG activity, except for the three muscles crossing the ankle's joint (GAS, SOL and TA). Intensity and duration of GM, VM, RF, BF, BB, TA, RA and ES activity were greater in standing while SM activity showed a slight decrease. In standing, global activity of upper limb was higher when the hand grip position was changed from brake level to the drops, but lower when the lateral sways of the bicycle were constrained. These results seem to be related to (1) the increase of the peak pedal force, (2) the change of the hip and knee joint moments, (3) the need to stabilize pelvic in reference with removing the saddle support, and (4) the shift of the mass centre forward. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Background: There is growing interest in designing cities that support not only walking, but also cycling. Bike Score® is a metric capturing environmental characteristics associated with cycling that is now available for over 160 US and Canadian cities. Our aim was to determine if Bike Score was associated with between and within-city variability in cycling behavior. Methods: We used linear regression to model associations between Bike Score and journey to work cycling mode share (US: American Community Survey, 2013 or 2012 5-year estimates; Canada: 2011 National Household Survey) for 5664 census tracts in 24 US and Canadian cities. Results: At the city level, the correlation between mean Bike Score and mean journey to work cycling mode share was moderate (r = 0.52). At the census tract level, the correlation was 0.35; a ten-unit increase in Bike Score was associated with a 0.5 % (95 % CI: 0.5 to 0.6) increase in the proportion of population cycling to work, a meaningful difference given the low modal shares (mean = 1.9 %) in many North American cities. Census tracts with the highest Bike Scores (>90 to 100) had mode shares 4.0 % higher (β = 4.0, 95 % CI: 2.9 to 5.0) than the lowest Bike Score areas (0-25). City specific analyses indicated between-city variability in associations, with regression estimates between Bike Score and mode share ranging from 0.2 to 3.5 %. Conclusions: The Bike Score metric was associated bicycle mode share between and within cities, suggesting its utility for planning bicycle infrastructure.},

   abstract = {On level ground, cycling is more economical than running, which in turn is more economical than walking in the high speed range. This paper investigates whether this ranking still holds when moving on a gradient, where the three modes are expected to be mainly facing the same burden, i.e. to counter gravity. By using data from the literature we have built a theoretical framework to predict the optimal mode as a function of the gradient. Cycling was found to be the mode of choice only below 10-15% gradient, while above it walking was the least expensive locomotion type. Seven amateur bikers were then asked to walk, run and ride on a treadmill at different gradients. The speed was set so as to maintain almost constant the metabolic demand across the different gradients. The results indicate that the "critical slope", i.e. the one above which walking is less expensive than cycling (and running), is about 13-15%. One subject was loaded during bipedal gaits with a bicycle-equivalent mass, to simulate to cross-country cycling situation. The critical slope was close to 20%, due to the higher metabolic cost of loaded walking and running. Part of the findings can be explained by the mechanically different paradigms of the three locomotion types.},

   abstract = {Data representing the trajectories of moving point objects are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in GIScience, and are the focus of much methodological research aimed at extracting patterns and meaning describing the underlying phenomena. However, current research within GIScience in this area has largely ignored issues related to scale and granularity - in other words how much are the patterns that we see a function of the size of the looking glass that we apply? In this article we investigate the implications of varying the temporal scale at which three movement parameters, speed, sinuosity and turning angle are derived, and explore the relationship between this temporal scale and uncertainty in the individual data points making up a trajectory. A very rich dataset, representing the movement of 10 cows over some two days every 0.25s is investigated. Our cross-scale analysis shows firstly, that movement parameters for all 10 cows are broadly similar over a range of scales when the data are segmented to remove quasi-static subtrajectories. However, by exploring realistic values of GPS uncertainty using Monte Carlo Simulation, it becomes apparent that fine scale measurement of all movement parameters is masked by uncertainties, and that we can only make meaningful statements about movement when we take these uncertainties into account. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Research in cyclist behavior has until now avoided complex models for cyclist speed, instead preferring simple average speeds aggregated from multiple cyclists travelling on different terrain. This paper applies methods from recent research to create a detailed linear model for cyclist speeds, which varies according to road characteristics. This model is estimated using GPS point data for Toronto bicycle trips, generated by a smartphone app published by the City of Toronto. The model results indicate that the negative effect of cycling uphill on speed is stronger than the positive effect of travelling downhill. Further, the results demonstrate that bicycle infrastructure such as bike paths and bike lanes significantly increases cycling speed. The findings are useful for planners and decision makers who want to propose guidelines to increase cycling speed in order to attract more people toward cycling.},

The best known thematic map type is the choropleth, in which regions are colored according to the distribution of a data variable. The R package tmap offers a coherent plotting system for thematic maps that is based on the layered grammar of graphics. Thematic maps are created by stacking layers, where per layer, data can be mapped to one or more aesthetics. It is also possible to generate small multiples. Thematic maps can be further embellished by configuring the map layout and by adding map attributes, such as a scale bar and a compass. Besides plotting thematic maps on the graphics device, they can also be made interactive as an HTML widget. In addition, the R package tmaptools contains several convenient functions for reading and processing spatial data.},

   abstract = {Microscopic traffic simulation is a useful tool for the planning of motorized traffic, yet bicycle traffic still lacks this type of modeling support. Nonetheless, certain microscopic traffic simulators, such as Vissim, model bicycle traffic by applying models originally designed for car traffic. The gradient of a bicycle path has a significant impact on the speed of cyclists; therefore, this impact should be captured in microscopic traffic simulation. We investigate two calibration approaches to reproduce the effect of gradient on the speed of cyclists using the default driver behavioral model in Vissim. The first approach is to modify the simulated gradient to represent different values of the gradient-acceleration parameter: a fixed value that represents a decrease in the maximum acceleration that cyclists can apply on an uphill. The second approach is to adjust the maximumacceleration function. We evaluate both approaches by applying a Vissim model of a bidirectional bicycle path with a 3% gradient in Stockholm. The results show that the current default implementation in the Vissim model underestimates the effect of gradient on speed. Moreover, the gradient-acceleration parameter does not directly reduce the maximum acceleration of all cyclists, but only of those cyclists riding above a certain speed. We conclude that by using a higher gradient-acceleration value than the default, we accurately estimate the observed mean speed on the uphill. However, neither of the investigated calibration approaches provides accurate estimates of the speed distributions. We emphasize the need for developing more accurate behavioral models designed for cyclists.},

   abstract = {This paper reports the results of a study of a cohort of cyclists to determine their speed and acceleration characteristics relative to gradient and other influencing factors in order to supply data for planners, designers and appraisers of cycle infrastructure schemes. A cohort of everyday cyclists was supplied with a global positioning system device and a heart rate monitor and asked to collect data from their journeys in Leeds, UK.The analysis determines the cyclists' speeds and accelerations at every point on their journey and elevation data, corroborated by mapping information, was used to determine the gradient. Two linear regression models of speed and acceleration were estimated and show that the influence of a downhill gradient on speed is less pronounced than the effect of an uphill gradient. The results indicate an eighty-fifth percentile speed on the flat of 22kph, and for a downhill gradient of 3%, 25kph. The power required to cycle has been estimated and shows that cyclists deliver around 150W on the flat, but that this rises to around 250W climbing hills. Mean acceleration on the flat is 0.231m/s2 and the average power output over the acceleration phase, which is of mean duration 26s, is approximately 120W. Air resistance accounts for approximately 70% of the resistive force when cycling at design speed.It is recommended that designers adopt 25. kph as a design speed for gradients less than 3%, but that consideration should be given to design speeds of up to 35. kph for steeper gradients. Free-flow speeds in this range should be used when modelling mode and route choices and in benefit appraisal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},
